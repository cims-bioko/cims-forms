# CIMS Forms

CIMS Forms, a fork of ODK Collect, is an Android app for filling out user-definable forms. It is part of the open source
tool suite called the Campaign information management system, or CIMS. It has been modified primarily to enable stable
and more streamlined integration with the CIMS suite of applications. 

CIMS Forms renders forms that are compliant with the [ODK XForms standard](http://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec/), 
a subset of the [XForms 1.1 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/) with some extensions.
